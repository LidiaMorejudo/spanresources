# Spanish Resources

Spanish Resources was developed by me for me and for people teaching and learning Spanish to share useful resources, opinions and thoughts about these. Users are able to register an account and send messages to me using the form on the contact page. As an admin of the site I am able to Create, Edit and Delete blog posts. The website employs a feature rich content editor for use with writing blog posts allowing the use of font sizing, italics, bold fonts, lists, externally hosted images etc

# Project Overview

Spanish Resources is a blog-style site built using **Python**, **Flask**, **SQLAlchemy**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **JavaScript**.

- User authentication and CRUD functionality is handled by a relational backend database (**PostgreSQL**)

Spanish Resources is my submission for the Milestone 3 Project by Code Institute in partnership with City of Bristol College for the Level 5 Diploma in Full Stack Web Application Development.

The choice to make this project was influenced by my desire to develop a resource information platform for Spanish teachers and learners to spread information about useful resources available freely on the Internet or easily available from purchase site.
