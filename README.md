# Spanish Resources

Spanish Resources was developed by me for me and for people teaching and learning Spanish to share useful resources, opinions and thoughts about these. Users are able to register an account and send messages to me using the form on the contact page. As an admin of the site I am able to Create, Edit and Delete blog posts. The website employs a feature rich content editor for use with writing blog posts allowing the use of font sizing, italics, bold fonts, lists, externally hosted images etc

# Project Overview

Spanish Resources is a blog-style site built using **Python**, **Flask**, **SQLAlchemy**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **JavaScript**.

- User authentication and CRUD functionality is handled by a relational backend database (**PostgreSQL**)

Spanish Resources is my submission for the Milestone 3 Project by Code Institute in partnership with City of Bristol College for the Level 5 Diploma in Full Stack Web Application Development.

The choice to make this project was influenced by my desire to develop a resource information platform for Spanish teachers and learners to spread information about useful resources available freely on the Internet or easily available from purchase site.

### Scope

#### Functionality Planning

This Viability Analysis evaluates the project’s scope by assessing the features I aim to include. By conducting this analysis, I can prioritize the most critical functionalities while postponing less essential features for future development. This approach ensures a focused and efficient workflow, allowing the project to meet its key objectives without unnecessary delays.

This is the table that shows the features:

| #   | Feature                                | Importance | Viability |
| --- | -------------------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: |
| 1   | View, Create, Edit & Delete Blog Posts |     5      |     5     |
| 2   | Registration Functionality             |     5      |     5     |
| 3   | Login/Logout Functionality             |     5      |     5     |
| 4   | Contact Form                           |     5      |     5     |
| 5   | Read/Delete Contact Form Submissions   |     5      |     5     |
| 6   | Blog Commenting Functionality          |     2      |     5     |
| 7   | Display Suggested Articles             |     1      |     2     |
| 8   | Share Blog Posts on Social Media       |     2      |     4     |
| 9   | Log User Activity                      |     2      |     2     |
| 10  | User Profile Page Functionality        |     2      |     5     |
| 11  | Search for Blog Posts                  |     1      |     4     |
| 12  | User Action Validation                 |     5      |     5     |
| 13  | Manage my profile                      |     1      |     4     |
| 14  | Comment on Articles                    |     4      |     4     |

For this project, I'm embracing the concept of a Minimally Viable Product (MVP) by focusing on the essential core functionality needed to meet the minimum required specifications. Rather than overwhelming the initial development sprint with too many features, I’ll strategically implement only the most crucial ones first.

To ensure a solid foundation, I will prioritize features 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 12 in the first sprint. This approach allows for a streamlined, efficient development process while ensuring that the application delivers its key functionalities right from the start.
